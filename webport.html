                      <p style="color: azure">In the world of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), understanding the basics of using a computer through tutorials is really important. HCI is all about how people use technology, and it aims to create systems and things on the computer that are easy for people to use, make sense, and work well. That's why knowing the basics of how computers work is important for both people who do HCI and regular computer users. 
                        Learning computer basics is like taking the first step to make sure people and computers can work together smoothly. People who do HCI make sure that when we use computers, it's easy and helps us get things done. To do this, they need to know the basic things about computers, just like the students in a computer tutorial program.
                        When HCI experts understand these computer basics, they can design things on the computer that match how people think and what they expect. This means they can create computer programs that are easy to use, don't make people think too hard, make the computer experience better, and help people work well with computers. So, having a good grasp of computer basics helps HCI professionals make smart choices, understand what users need, and make digital stuff that's easy to use.
                        In simple words, learning the basics of computers through tutorials is a strong foundation for people who work in Human-Computer Interaction. It helps them make computer things that make it easier for all of us to use computers and digital stuff in a better way.
